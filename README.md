# Linear Regression
An implementation of Linear Regression from scratch in python ðŸ“ˆ. 

## What Is Linear Regression?
Linear regression is a method for approximating a linear relationship between two variables. While that may sound complicated, all it really means is that it takes some input variable, like the age of a house, and finds out how it's related to another variable, for example, the price it sells at.
## Linear Regression Steps
    1. Randomly initialising parameters for the hypothesis function
    2. Computing the mean squared error
    3. Calculating the partial derivatives
    4. Updating the parameters based on the derivatives and the learning rate
    5. Repeating from 2 until the error is minimised
